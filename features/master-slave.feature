    Then the last query succeeded on "conn"
    And "conn" is on master

    Scenario: Read prepared statement on slave
        When I query "SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?" with param 'max@yopmail.com' on "conn"
        Then the last query succeeded on "conn"

         Then the last query succeeded on "conn"
          And "conn" is on slave

    Scenario: "Write" request on master
         When I exec "SET @var = 1" on "conn"
         Then the last query succeeded on "conn"
          And "conn" is on master

    Scenario: Keep slave after "Write" request

          And I query "SELECT 1" on "conn"
         Then the last query succeeded on "conn"
          And "conn" is on slave

    Scenario: Connect on master when there is no slaves
        Given a master-slaves connection "connMaster" with 0 slaves
         When I query "SELECT 1" on "connMaster"
         Then the last query succeeded on "connMaster"
